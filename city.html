	<h1>This city is called Senesis City</h1>
	<p>I'm a pretty down to earth guy but I usually know how to properly stand out well. Even though I work at a coffee shop, I'm easily the most popular employee in there due to my excellent customer service and I'm kind to everyone around me. I also stand out due to my abudance of always wearing the color green and using my magic to basically be the best employee on the job.</p>
